# EmulationStation Toolkit
*A Toolkit full of little Extra bits for EmulationStation on Windows.*

---

**This is a work in progress. Many parts of the Toolkit are currently missing. I'm steadily working on it and it should hopefully be complete soon**

---

I've put this Toolkit together to help people that want to start making themes for EmulationStation and RetroPie (and possibly RecalBox too. I haven't tried it, so I don't know how much help any of this will be for them).

It's basically a starting point that contains (fake\*) Roms with pre-scraped metadata, images and videos so you can just jump right in and start creating.

**Items in this Toolkit include:**
- Bat files to launch ES in different Windowed sizes.
- 100 (fake\*) Roms over 5 Systems: Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, N64, NES and SNES (20 Roms each).
- Scraped metadata, artwork and videos for each every Rom.
- Custom Scrape and MIX Profiles for the [Universal XML Scraper](https://github.com/Universal-Rom-Tools/Universal-XML-Scraper/).
- A custom Theme that supports Video Previews and the Carousel Mod.
  
All images, logos and videos have been scraped with the Universal XML Scraper

>\* **There are no real Roms in this Repo.** They are just .txt files that have been renamed to match real games from their respective Systems. If you want real Roms you will have to find them yourself, I can't help you with that.
