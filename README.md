# ES-extras
Extra bits for EmulationStation on Windows

The idea behind this Repo is just to provide all the necessary bits for people who download one of the Windows ES builds like the [Video Preview](https://github.com/fieldofcows/EmulationStation/releases/tag/v0.1-beta.7) build by @fieldofcows or the [Carousel build](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/859248/RetroPieES/SystemCarousel_mod_beta_22feb2017.7z) by @Zigurana.

Extras include:
- Bat files to launch ES in different Windowed sizes
  - Full screen - 1920x1080
  - Mid screen - 1280x720
  - 4:3 - 1024x768
  
- Rom folders for multiple Systems, each with a number of fake roms. (Please note, these are just empty .txt files that have been renamed to match the expected file extensions. *THEY ARE NOT REAL ROMS*).

- Scraped images and videos for each of the included Systems and Roms.
  - Scraped images include Box-art, Fan-art, Logos, Screenshots and Cartridges (where available).
  - I have also included a basic MIX image from [UXS](https://github.com/Universal-Rom-Tools/Universal-XML-Scraper/) for each of the Roms.
  - The files are named like this:
    - Aladdin-boxart.png
    - Aladdin-fanart.jpg
    - Aladdin-screenshot.jpg
    - Aladdin-cartridge.png
    - Aladdin-logo.png
    - Aladdin-mix.png
    - Aladdin-video.mp4

- Gamelists for each of the included Systems and Roms.
  - All videos are within "video" tags.
  - All "image" tags are filled with the Screenshots.
  - All "marquee" tags are filled the Logos.

- A custom Theme that supports Video Preview.
  - This is a basic theme without much ornamentation, to be used as both a learning tool, and a base/starting point for your own theme.
  - This theme only supports the Systems that have Roms in this download.
  
All images, logos and videos have been scraped with the Universal XML Scraper
