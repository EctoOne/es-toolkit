# BaseVid
Theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie

## About the BaseVid Theme

This theme was created so people can use it as a learning tool, and also as a base for creating their own themes.

The default System View looks like this:  
![System View 1](http://i.imgur.com/oyQhAUq.jpg)

BaseVid also supports the Carousel Mod by [Zigurana](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/user/zigurana). The code for both Vertical and Horizontal Carousels are supplied, you just need to un-comment the one you want to use, and make sure the others are commented out.

> Note: If you try to use the code for these Carousels on a version of ES without the Carousel Mod, the theme will break.

The other views look like this:

> Note: The "Detailed" and "Video" Views look identical. That is deliberate. The Video will start playing after a 1 second pause.
