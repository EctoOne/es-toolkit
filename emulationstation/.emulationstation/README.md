# .emulationstation

The `.emulationstation` folder contains a `roms` folder and a `themes` folder.

## Roms

Within this folder are folders for 4 Systems and 1 global System, each with 25 fake Roms, pre-populated gamelist.xml with different views (basic/detailed/video)
 and a bunch of fake images in 3 different layouts (square/landscape/portrait) and a fake video which are used by 4 of the systems.

You can see which system uses which image layout by looking at the gamelists, the fake Rom names are used as description.
