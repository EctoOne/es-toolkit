#.emulationstation

Everything within this "emulationstation" folder is meant to replace the ".emulationstaion" folder that comes with most Windows versions of ES.

Just delete the contents of your ".emulationstation" folder and replace with the contents of this folder.

> If you are squeemish, you can always backup the contents of the ".emulationstation" folder elsewhere before deleting it.

**NOTE:** *This folder does not contain the RetroArch files required to actually play roms (in .emulationsation/systems/retroarch), so if you are using the Portable ES version by @Herb_Fargus, then you should leave that folder intact.*
