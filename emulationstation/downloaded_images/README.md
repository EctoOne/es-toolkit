#Downloaded Images

These are the scraped Media for each of the Roms in the Roms folder. Media includes:
- Screenshots
- 3D Box-art
- 2D Box-art
- Fan-art
- Logos
- Cartridges
- MIX Images from the "Mattrixk (video).zip" MIX Profile (Logo, 3D Box-art and Cartridge)
- MIX Images from the "Mattrixk (no-video).zip" MIX Profile (Logo, Screenshot, 3D Box-art and Cartridge)
- ~~Videos~~ (I have decided to create a separate Repo for Videos, as they take up so much space). I will update this with the link to them once I've done it.)

**NOTE:** Not all Roms have all Media. eg: Most Gameboy Roms are missing both Fan-art and Cartridge.

> This is a Work-In-Progress and not all of these are up yet.
