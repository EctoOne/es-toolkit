#Downloaded Images

These are the scraped Media for each of the Roms in the Roms folder. Media includes:
- Screenshots
- 3D Box-art
- 2D Box-art
- Fan-art
- Logos
- Cartridges
- MIX Images from the "Mattrixk (video).zip" MIX Profile (Logo, 3D Box-art and Cartridge)
- MIX Images from the "Mattrixk (no-video).zip" MIX Profile (Logo, Screenshot, 3D Box-art and Cartridge)
- ~~Videos~~ Videos have been moved to a separate Repo as they take up so much space. You can get them from https://github.com/mattrixk/es-toolkit-videos.

**NOTE:** Not all Roms have all Media. eg: Most Gameboy Roms are missing both Fan-art and Cartridge.
